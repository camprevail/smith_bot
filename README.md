# A discord bot for the foodbeat players

Written, hosted and maintained by Cammy.

Linux crontab will manage the `daily.js` script to post an new pre-randomized image at a fixed time once per day.  

Current bot commands for all users are:  
`.daily` (reposts current day's translated jubeat image from tex_l44fo_step_transition)  
`.e [insert any server emoji or animated emoji]` (Replies will full size emoji)
